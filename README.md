### Dynamic Weather Dashboard

GitHub Pages:  https://faduma92.github.io/Dynamic-Weather-Dashboard/

This app uses the OpenWeather API to retrieve current weather and 5-day forecast data for cities using "search" inputs and geolocation.

It uses AJAX to hook into the API to retrieve data in JSON format.


This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.


It then displays the following under current weather conditions:


- City


- Date


- Icon image (visual representation of weather conditions)


- Temperature


- Humidity


- Wind speed


- UV index




It includes a search history so that users can access their past search terms.


It includes a 5-Day Forecast below the current weather conditions. Each day for the 5-Day Forecast displays the following:


- Date


- Icon image (visual representation of weather conditions)


- Temperature


- Humidity
